=== "Lyrics"
    ```
    Turn your magic on, umi she'd say
    Everything you want's a dream away
    We are legends, every day
    That's what she told him

    Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
    Everything you want's a dream away
    Under this pressure, under this weight
    We are diamonds

    Now I feel my heart beating
    I feel my heart beneath my skin
    I feel my heart beating
    Oh, you make me feel
    Like I'm alive again
    Alive again
    Oh, you make me feel
    Like I'm alive again

    Said I can't go on, not in this way
    I'm a dream that died by light of day
    Gonna hold up half the sky and say
    Only I own me

    Now I feel my heart beating
    I feel my heart beneath my skin
    Oh, I can feel my heart beating
    'Cause you make me feel
    Like I'm alive again
    Alive again
    Oh, you make me feel
    Like I'm alive again
    Turn your magic on, umi she'd say
    Everything you want's a dream away
    Under this pressure, under this weight
    We are diamonds taking shape
    We are diamonds taking shape
    (Woo-ooh, woo-ooh)
    If we've only got this life
    This adventure, oh then I
    And if we've only got this life
    You'll get me through, oh
    And if we've only got this life
    And this adventure, oh then I
    Wanna share it with you
    With you, with you
    Sing it, oh, say yeah
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
    Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)

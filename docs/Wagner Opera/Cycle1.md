# Das Rheingold (The Rhinegold)

## Synopsis:

The opera opens in the Rhine River, where the Rhine Maidens guard the gold that can grant immense power. Alberich, a Nibelung dwarf, steals the gold after renouncing love. He forges a ring that gives him control over the world. Wotan, the chief god, desires the ring to secure his power and sends his giants, Fasolt and Fafner, to build Valhalla, his new fortress. Wotan ultimately takes the ring from Alberich, leading to a curse that brings doom to all who possess it.

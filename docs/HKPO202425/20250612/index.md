Here is Beethoven at his most optimistic and exultant, writing a piece that would come to redefine the expressive power of the concerto. And here is a superstar of the violin to perform it for us: the incomparable Hilary Hahn returns to Seattle to play Beethoven as only she can. Music Director Designate Xian Zhang returns to Seattle for this powerhouse program, which also includes Prokofievâ€™s Fifth Symphony. Composed in 1944, it looked to a horizon beyond the devastation of war. Its first performance in Moscow was punctuated by a victory salute of cannon fire, signaling the final campaign to end the war. Prokofiev marked the end in sight with a scurrying dash to the final victory.
